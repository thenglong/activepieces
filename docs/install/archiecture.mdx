This page focus on production archiecture and tech specs, there are three main parts:

## Components

![Architecture](/resources/architecture.png)


### Redis

Redis is used as message queue, it used to store jobs that need to be processed, It's also used as locking machaism.

### Postgres 

Postgres is used as main database, it used to store all data.

### Main Container

Activepieces is single stateless service, it can be scaled horizontally. Workers and API server are in same service, but they can be seperated by environment variable to not process jobs.

### Tech Specs

Activepieces is not cpu intensive in general and small instance is enough for most cases, the requirement are different depend on the use cases.

| Component           | Memory (RAM) | CPU Cores | Notes                               |
|---------------------|--------------|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| PostgreSQL          | [1 GB]       | [1]       |   |
| Redis               | [1 GB]       | [1]       |      |
| Activepieces        | [8 GB]       | [2]      | for high avaiability It better to deploy over multiple machines|


## Scaling

**Redis:** You don't need to make Redis bigger because it only stores jobs while they're being processed. Activepieces uses BullMQ, which can handle a lot of jobs each second.

**Postgres:** You also don't have to increase the size of PostgreSQL. It's only used for storing data, and it doesn't need a lot of CPU power.

**Activepieces:**

To make Activepieces handle more work, you can add more instances. For the suggested setup, set the worker concurrency in the environment variable to 20 on each machine.

With this setup, it can handle more than **20 million executions** monthly, including flow runs and background polling executions.

The main thing to consider when deciding to scale is how often it checks for new items. For example, if you have a 5-minute check, it will be executed 8,640 times in a month.
